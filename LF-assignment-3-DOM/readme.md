# Ball Collision Simulation

This project is a simple JavaScript simulation that demonstrates elastic collision between balls. When two balls collide, they obey the laws of elastic collision, conserving momentum and kinetic energy.

## Features

- Simulates elastic collision between multiple balls on a canvas.
- Allows customization of ball properties such as size, color, and initial velocity.
- Provides a visually interactive demonstration of physics principles.

## Installation

To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ball-collision.git
   ```
